              Michael had a job, but struggled with depression. He
              self-medicated with drugs, which led him to develop a heroin
              habit. He had lost his job and was living on the street when he
              had his first overdose. A friend, who also was using heroin, gave
              him Narcan and managed to call 911, but when EMTs arrived, Michel
              refused to go to the hospital.

              The overdose spooked Michael, and he started to visit Prevention
              Point. He began to develop a relationship with the case managers,
              but kept his distance. Trust is a particular issue with homeless
              people, who make up about 80% of the clients for PP’s services.
              Besides the stigma of their situation, they are frequent victims
              of theft, which can include documents and prescriptions as well as
              whatever possessions they carry with them. Michael said he wanted
              to change his situation. He did not want to live on the streets
              doing heroin, but he was not able to change things on his own, and
              he was not ready to trust someone’s help. He had stayed at a
              couple of shelters, but did not like being crowded together with
              so many other people, so many of whom were using drugs.

              The stresses of the situation deepened Michael’s depression and he
              started having suicidal thoughts. One day he felt so desperate
              that he went on his own to a crisis center (?). The staff told him
              that he would have to sit in the waiting room for at least 24
              hours so they could verify that his mental distress was not caused
              by any drugs he was taking. If he left, they warned, he would have
              to start the waiting time over. The state requires them to follow
              this protocol in order to receive funding. Michael had not eaten
              for hours before he arrived. At some point the staff gave him a
              pack of crackers and an orange juice. After about 10 hours, he
              left.

              Back on the streets, he was using heroin and barely surviving.
              Michael later told caseworkers that he was no longer getting high
              from the drug, just using it to avoid going into withdrawal. He
              overdosed and was brought around with Narcan at least one more
              time, but was even more vehement about not going to a hospital.

              The realization that he would die on the streets hit him, he says,
              after he found himself mixing heroin one day with water from a
              puddle in the street. He managed to call PP and ask someone to
              take him to the hospital. A caseworker took him to the University
              of Pennsylvania Hospital, knowing that he would be treated better
              there than at some other hospitals.

              After doctors treated him for a blood infection, Michael talked
              with a recovery specialist working at the hospital. He agreed to
              enter an intensive methadone outpatient treatment program. Despite
              the difficulties of participating in a program that required him
              to be present 5 days a week, he was able to stay with the program
              for a while, with support from caseworkers.

            <div class="subSticky">
              Eventually, Michael could not keep up with the program
              requirements and was not allowed to continue. He had been able to
              enter the program without insurance, which is much more possible
              with outpatient programs, but one of the first things caseworkers
              did was to set him up with a P.O. Box through PP, essential for
              accessing government services, and to get him enrolled in
              Medicare. They were aware that he had dropped out of the methadone
              program, and when one of them saw him on the street one day, they
              gave him some Narcan for emergency use as a way of letting him
              know that they knew he was using again.

          <div class="step" data-step="8">
            <div class="subSticky">
              A short time later, he came to PP and asked for help to get back
              into treatment. More options were available now that he had
              Medicare. However, Michael finally had a stroke of luck. Few
              residential programs will accept someone with mental health
              issues, but caseworkers were able to get him accepted into one of
              them.

              Michael finished the 28-day program and has continued to make
              progress with recovery groups. He is living in a transitional
              residence and hopes to be able to go through training to be a
              recovery counselor.
