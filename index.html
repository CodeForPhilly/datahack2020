              I started with smoking marijuana with the neighborhood kids when I was roughly 13. Once I was 17, I started smoking crack cocaine. The drug use made me feel untouchable, euphoric, and strong. As a woman, it is often difficult to be all these things.

              I graduated high school in 2004 and took a year off before I joined the Navy. In the Navy, there are many repercussions for substance use with a zero tolerance policy, so my substance use was at a halt. I felt like serving my country and defending the freedom for the U.S.A. was a lot more important than utilizing drugs. My last two years enlisted, I was stationed at Guantanamo Bay as a Corrections Officer. After that experience, I felt I needed to discharge from the Navy and come home to my family.

              I got out of the Navy in December 13, 2009. By December 14, 2009, I was already abusing crack cocaine and methamphetamines. I had a
              nice run for about two years and ended up selling drugs to a confidential informant.

              When I got out of jail after my first drug charge, they offered me a 28-day rehabilitation program at the Wilkes-Barre VA Medical
              Center. Once I left, I immediately started using again. I think being forced to not use substances made me want to use even more.

              I violated probation for the first time and was sent back to prison for roughly four months. They offered me another 28-day
              program. Once I got out of the program, I instantly relapsed. I felt that every time I went to rehab, my drug counselors were not
              out for my best interest. They did not want to get to know me personally. It was almost as if they felt all drug addicts were
              the same and always would be.

              As I continued relapsing, I was also violating my probation. I keep violating, and every time I violated, they kept incarcerating
              me. It’s a revolving door, in and out, back to rehab, get out, use again, go back to jail, go back to rehab, get out, go back to
              jail. I was going in and out of rehabilitation, jail, relapse, and recovery for a good portion of almost six or seven years.

              I had started with crack cocaine and then I thought, “Wow, it was just way too expensive for me.” This led to me wanting something
              stronger and stronger. The first time that I ever used heroin, I injected it. This was a very different rush for me. I continued
              using and finding ways and means not to go into withdrawal. Using drugs was a 24/7/365 job. I would wake up and sometimes be so
              disgusted knowing I had to go out and get my next fix.

              About a year ago, I was arrested for heroin distribution and thrown into the county jail once again. The military, the rehabs,
              and jails never changed me. I was so tired and so worn down. Then I tried something different. I volunteered myself to stay in a
              Veteran’s Transitional Residence sober house for an extended year. I was on Vivitrol for nine months. That helped with cravings and
              urges. But, I ended up getting an allergic reaction from it, so I had to stop. I was offered Suboxone and methadone, but I had no
              interest in doing that. I was over the need for a crutch.

              I am not a very big fan of Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous. It is just not my thing. I work through SMART recovery.
              I have a wonderful support group as well as the support of all my family. The VA has also really helped me find different coping
              skills for situations when I feel the desire to use.

              My next step in recovery is to continue staying sober. I feel like there has to be something out there that I can get involved in to
              keep my sobriety strong. Just because everybody is involved in NA or AA does not necessarily mean that I have to take that same
              road. I feel like recovery is different for everybody and what works for some, may not work for others.

            <div class="subSticky">
              One struggle I face is stigma. I should not have to defend my personality and history to people who do not even want to take
              this epidemic seriously. I have encountered this stigma in the criminal justice system, the VA hospitals, counselors, and rehabs.
              Some people think you are not going to be anything better or more than a drug addict. That’s not true. There is always hope, and I
              think if more people treated this like a medical disease, there would be empathy and less stigma toward people with substance use
              disorder.
