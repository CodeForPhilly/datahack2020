## Description

Code for Philly, DataPhilly, R Ladies Philly, the Philly Data Jawn, Health Federation of Philadelphia, Prevention Point, the City of Philadelphia are hosting a data science hackathon to answer pertinent questions around the Opioid Crisis in Philadelphia.

### 3. How many IV drug users are in Philadelphia?

### 4. Data exploration

e.g. Can we infer death rate and overdose rate from census data?

## [Timeline and Workflow](https://codeforphilly.org/events/datahack2020)

The hack is slated to begin on Friday February 7, 2020 with a kickoff event. Partner organizations will present what their group does and why these questions are relevant to them. The next day, participants will have several hours to form their team, consider the questions, and devise a plan to conduct their relevant analysis. Over the next five weeks, these teams will work on their analyses and write their presentations.

## Code of Conduct

The organizing groups are dedicated to creating a hackathon that reflects the diversity of the City of Philadelphia, and to providing a friendly, safe, welcoming, and harrassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, mental and/or physical ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and religion (or lack thereof). This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in this hackathon, as well as consequences for unacceptable behavior that contributes to making anyone feel unsafe or unwelcome in our community. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon at the discretion of the leadership team. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

We expect all participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business. This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

This Code of Conduct was adapted for the hackathon from the [Code for Philly Code of Conduct](https://codeforphilly.org/pages/code_of_conduct/) and the [R-Ladies Code of Conduct](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/).

### 1. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all hackathon participants:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. 
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. For more details and examples, see section 5.
- Help us maintain an environment that encourages social entrepreneurship and civic mindedness.
- Do not assume someone has a specific skill, experience, or education or judge them based on a perceived lack in any of those areas. Instead, help us inspire productivity in our fellow community members regardless of specific skill.
- Refrain from policing community membership based on location. We define “Philly” broadly to include those who live, work, or visit Philadelphia as well as the towns and suburbs neighboring the city.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

### 2. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable among participants of this hackathon:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person, including incitement of violence towards any individual (e.g. including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm).

- Inappropriate or non-consensual photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.

- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Deliberate silencing of other community members in the form of constant interruption, undermining the thoughts and opinions of others, or otherwise perpetuating demeaning commentary
- Advocating for, encouraging, or any form of tolerating any of the above behavior.

- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.

### 3. Reporting

If you are being harassed by another participant, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the leadership team via safespace@codeforphilly.org. 

Leadership team members are available to help participants engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. Organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of our participants or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

### 4. Violation Process

If a participant is found to be in violation of this code of conduct, they will be informed verbally and/or in writing by the leadership team. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If the individual is not an immediate threat to the community, they will be issued a warning. If, after receiving an initial warning, the individual is found to have violated the code of conduct a second time, that individual can be expelled from the hackathon. When expelled, they will not be granted access to in-person events and will be removed from all hackathon-related social media platforms. Consideration will be given at all times to the severity of a given code of conduct violation. If it is in the best interest of the community for an individual to immediately be expelled from the hackathon, it is the discretion of the leadership team to do so.

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the leadership team with a concise description of your grievance.
