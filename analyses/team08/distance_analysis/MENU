distance_calculation.py = code for calculations
distance_analysis.csv = see final 2 columns for "nearby bupe program" counts & lists per census tract
distance_matrix.csv = table of as-crow-flies mileage to each census tract center from each of 26 programs listed in DBHIDS TAD as offering buprenorphine
geocoded_dbhids_mat-locations_tad-2020-02-28.csv = source file for buprenorphine according to DBHIDS TAD (geocodes added)

Note that each DISTINCT SITE needs a DISTINCT LABEL for accurate outcomes. For programs with multiple sites (Merakey Behavioral Health, NET Centers, Wedge Medical Center), zip code was added to distinguish labels.

TAD-BupeDistance_Nearest3Sites_Sorted-by-ODsDESC.xlsx = sorts tracts by severity of OD #s; identifies distance to nearest 3 sites per tract; runs basic calculations for average distance

TAD-BupeDistance_HighNeedTracts-by-Neighborhoods.xlsx = labels high-need tracts by neighborhood for ease of human reference
