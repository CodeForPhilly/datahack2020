Aggravated Assault
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
An attack by one person on another with the purpose of inflicting severe or grievous injury. Generally a weapon is involved, although it is possible to have an aggravated assault that does not include a weapon. Attempted murder (e.g. a shooting that does not result in death) is classified as Aggravated Assault by the police.
</div>
<div class="dao-definition-title-word">

Bail
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
<p>A set of pre-trial conditions placed upon the accused to allow them to be released from custody while awaiting trial. <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=00&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=1&amp;sctn=14&amp;subsctn=0">The purpose of the conditions are to reasonably ensure public safety</a>.</p>
In Philadelphia, people often receive monetary bail conditions (e.g., $10,000), meaning they must pay the Commonwealth some set amount of money to be released from custody while awaiting trial. When the accused successfully completes their trial without missing any appearances or otherwise violating their bail conditions, their money is returned. If they fail to meet their bail conditions, they may lose their bail money. When a person is given cash bail, they can often pay 10% of the full amount (also called “bond”), but will owe the full amount if they violate their bail conditions.

If a person wins an appeal or collateral attack and a new resolution is entered on the case, the time to that new disposition is measured in lieu of the time between their arrest and intial resolution.
</div>
<div class="dao-definition-title-word">
Charges
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
<p>A charge is an accusation by the Commonwealth that a person has committed a crime. Although a case often involves more than one charge, our <a href="Charge_Report.html">Charge Report</a> only looks at the most serious offense charged in each criminal case.</p>
In Philadelphia, the DAO, not the police, is responsible for deciding whether to charge an individual. Generally speaking, police investigate a case and present their investigation to the DAO. The DAO then determines whether there is enough evidence to file criminal charges and what charges should be filed. It is common that a person is charged with multiple offenses in a single criminal case. For example, Simple Assault is often charged at the same time as Recklessly Endangering Another Person.

Disposition
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
Refers to how a case was completed or resolved. This may include a finding of guilt, a guilty plea, diversion, a finding of not guilty, or that the case was dismissed or withdrawn.
</div>
<div class="dao-definition-title-word">
Diversion
</div>
<div class='dao-definition'>
<p>Diversion is a procedure by which the DAO removes cases from the usual path through the criminal justice process of incarceration and probation. Diversion allows the accused to participate in a program that is often court supervised and, if completed successfully, will serve the needs of the criminal justice system. The programs are designed to be rehabilitative rather than punitive and the goal is to redirect individuals who have committed minor crime into a lifestyle that will keep them away from criminal involvement. Some of the benefits of diversionary programs are:</p></li>
<li>People are able to stay in the community while being held accountable.</li>
<li>Their specialized nature allows for targeting of specific programs for specific types of people (e.g., drug treatment for people with drug disuse disorders).</li>
<li>Many allow for the charges to be cleared from the accused’s record after successful program completion. This helps people move on from their contact with the criminal justice system without the lifetime burden a criminal record can pose in finding housing, employment, and other important life activities.</li>
<li><p>They allow the accused to quickly move out of the criminal justice system, bringing swift resolution of the case and reducing loads on overburdened agencies and system actors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.phila.gov/districtattorney/diversion/Pages/default.aspx">common diversion programs in Philadelphia include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMP I and AMP II (Accelerated Misdemeanor Program)</li>
<li>Domestic Violence Diversion</li>
<li>Veteran’s Court</li>
<li>ARD (Accelerated Misdemeanor Program)</li>

</div>
<div class="dao-definition-title-word">
Exoneration
</div>
<div class='dao-definition'>
In general, an exoneration occurs when a person who has been convicted of a crime is officially cleared based on new evidence of innocence.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/glossary.aspx">The more precise definition is more complicated</a>: A person has been exonerated if he or she was convicted of a crime and, following a post-conviction re-examination of the evidence in the case, was either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Declared to be factually innocent by a government official or agency with the authority to make that declaration; or</li>
<li>Relieved of all the consequences of the criminal conviction by a government official or body with the authority to take that action. The official action may be:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>a complete pardon by a governor or other competent authority, whether or not the pardon is designated as based on innocence;</li>
<li>an acquittal of all charges factually related to the crime for which the person was originally convicted; or</li>
<li>a dismissal of all charges related to the crime for which the person was originally convicted, by a court or by a prosecutor with the authority to enter that dismissal.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The pardon, acquittal, or dismissal must have been the result, at least in part, of evidence of innocence that either:</p>
<pre><code>i. was not presented at the trial at which the person was convicted; or 
ii. if the person pled guilty, was not known to the defendant and the defense attorney, and to the court, at the time the plea was entered. </code></pre>
The evidence of innocence need not be an explicit basis for the official action that exonerated the person. A person who otherwise qualifies has not been exonerated if there is unexplained physical evidence of that person’s guilt.

First Judicial District (FJD)
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
The Pennsylvania court system is divided into “judicial districts.” The judicial district that operates in Philadelphia is called the First Judicial District (“FJD”). The Courts that comprise the FJD are the Municipal Court (which includes Traffic Court) and the Court of Common Pleas (which includes both the criminal and family courts). Because Philadelphia is large, the FJD covers just Philadelphia. Other Judicial Districts can cover more than one county.

Fraud/Theft of Services
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
Fraud is intentionally lying or manipulating the truth in order to gain something of value. Theft of services, similarly, occurs when a person gets the benefit of a service known to cost money (e.g. turnstile jumping). The Philadelphia DAO generally charges offense classified at arrest as ‘fraud’ as ‘theft’ under the criminal code.

<div class="dao-definition-title-word">
Future Years of Incarceration
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
<p>All of the years of incarceration imposed on defendants in all cases that ended in a given time period. For example, the future years of incarceration imposed in Philadelphia on a particular day can be calculated by adding up all of the carceral sentences imposed on all defendants in Philadelphia that day.</p>
<p>To calculate future years of incarceration, we make a few assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We only track the jail/prison time that we assume a person will serve.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in the Philadelphia jails (sentences with a maximum of less than 2 years) will be released at their minimum sentence length.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in state prison (sentences with a maximum sentence of 2 years or more) will be released at 130% of their minimum sentence (e.g., a person with a 1-2 year sentence will be released in 1.3 years).</li>
<li>Consolidated sentences are treated as concurrent, not consecutive. When a person is sentenced in multiple cases on a single day, we assume that these cases have been consolidated and dealt with as a group. For the purpose of future years, we only look at the longest minimum and maximum sentences from that group of cases.</li>
<li>We only look at original sentences, not violations of parole or probation.</li>
</ol>
One of the goals of DA Larry Krasner’s policies is to reduce the number of years of future incarceration and future supervision. Overly long prison sentences and terms of parole and probation cost millions in public dollars without improving public safety. In fact, research show that mass incarceration and over-supervision actually have a negative effect on people and communities. By making plea offers and sentencing recommendations below the low end of the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines, DA Krasner has espoused a different approach to sentencing policy. This will save millions of dollars that could be used to improve education, repair infrastructure and improve living conditions for all Philadelphians, while at the same time insuring that criminal behavior is punished appropriately.

<div class="dao-definition-title-word">
Future Years of Supervision
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
<p>All of the years of supervision imposed on defendants in all cases that ended in a given time period. For example, the future years of supervision imposed in Philadelphia on a particular day can be calculated by adding up all of the probation and parole sentences imposed on all defendants in Philadelphia that day.</p>
<p>To calculate future years of supervision, we make a few assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We only track the supervision time that a person will actually serve.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in the Philadelphia jails (sentences with a maximum of less than 2 years) will be released at their minimum sentence length. The balance of their sentence (max - min) is counted as supervision.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in state prison (sentences with a maximum sentence of 2 years or more) will be released at 130% of their minimum sentence (e.g. a person with a 1-2 year sentence will be released in 1.3 years). The balance of their sentence (max - 1.3 x min) is counted as supervision.</li>
<li>Consolidated sentences are treated as concurrent, not consecutive. When a person is sentenced in multiple cases on a single day, we assume that these cases have been consolidated and dealt with as a group. For the purpose of future years, we only look at the longest minimum and maximum sentences from that group of cases.</li>
<li>We only look at original sentences, not violations of probation or parole.</li>
</ol>
One of the goals of DA Krasner’s policies is to reduce the number of years of Future Supervision. Research shows that periods of probation or parole supervision that last beyond three years without any violations have diminishing returns and instead keep people needlessly ensnared in the system. In making plea offers and sentencing recommendations, the DAO is very cognizant of this finding. Because of the requirements of Pennsylvania’s sentencing laws, it is not always possible to limit parole following an sentence to incarceration for a reasonable amount of time. But, to the extent possible, the DAO is attempting to reduce the amount of time people are required to spend on probation and parole.

<li>A <strong>negotiated</strong> plea is an agreement between the DAO and the accused on the charges that the accused will admit guilt to, the charges that will be dropped, and the sentence that will be recommended to the judge for the case. The agreement is sometimes called a plea bargain.</li>
<li>An <strong>open plea</strong> is one where the accused admits guilt and then the judge sets the sentence without a recommendation from the DAO.
